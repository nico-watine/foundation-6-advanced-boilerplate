So everytime scripts.js (or anything else in /js) is processed by Codekit, app.js is wiped clean bc Codekit doesn't "process" it, but the CLI pipe is interrupted for app.js (via imports specified in config.yml)

-This sounds super smarrrrt


scripts.js is now placed in js/custom/. This will make it easier now to specify which JS files exactly are affected by javascript_other
